# KnightDash at Calvin University

## Vision Statement
KnightDash will be a food ordering and delivery system designed as an intracampus solution for Calvin University. Currently, the only options for students who cannot or prefer not to visit the dining halls are to go hungry, order delivery from an outside company, or to use the Eatable app to order pickup (and perhaps beg a friend to deliver it).

This application will seek to address these shortcomings, with its primary functions being:

1) to provide students and faculty with a simple and efficient way of ordering and receiving food

2) to allow enterprising students to make money on campus while simultaneously providing a service

3) to increase revenue for dining halls by adding a flexible purchasing option

4) to benefit Calvin by keeping most food revenue streams within its community.

By remaining specialized to Calvin, KnightDash will be able to perform efficiently without being heavily reliant on the number of people interacting with it. In addition, unlike major competitors such as DoorDash, KnightDash will be able to provide inexpensive delivery fees while reducing delivery time by remaining primarily intracampus.
