# KnightDash at Calvin University

Currently, the only options for Calvin students and faculty who cannot or prefer not to visit the dining halls are to go hungry, to order delivery from an outside company, or to use the Eatable app to order pickup (and perhaps beg a friend to deliver it). 

Our solution, KnightDash, will address these shortcomings by providing an intracampus food ordering and delivery system with the following features: 

* providing students and faculty with a simple and efficient way of ordering and receiving food

* allowing enterprising students to make money by providing a useful service

* increasing revenue for dining halls by adding a flexible purchasing option

* benefiting Calvin by keeping most food revenue streams within its community.

By remaining specialized to Calvin, KnightDash will be able to perform efficiently without being heavily reliant on the number of people interacting with it. In addition, unlike major competitors such as DoorDash, KnightDash will be able to provide inexpensive delivery fees while reducing delivery time by remaining primarily intracampus.
